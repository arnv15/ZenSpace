ZenSpace Inspiration
As students, we often struggle to find the right place to study or relax. Whether it’s working on a group project or just needing a quiet spot with good WiFi, the lack of reliable information on things like noise levels or availability can be frustrating.

ZenSpace was born out of this challenge — to create a tool that helps students balance productivity and well-being.

🚀 What It Does
ZenSpace is a web app that helps students discover study or recreation spots that best fit their needs.

  Spots are created by students for students.
  
  Each spot is rated on key factors such as:
  
  WiFi quality
  
  Seating availability
  
  Noise level
  
  We’ve already set up a database of known spots in our local area to get students started.

🛠️ How We Built It
  Frontend: ReactJS
  
  Backend: Python + Flask (for routes and API calls)
  
  AI Integration: OpenAI API
  
  Database: A low-cost/free solution optimized for quick setup

⚔️ Challenges We Ran Into
  Combining both study and recreation data into a single, intuitive experience.
  
  Finding a database solution that was both affordable and reliable.

✅ Accomplishments We’re Proud Of
  Built a fully functional MVP in just 36 hours.
  
  Designed a clean, user-friendly interface.
  
  Successfully connected Flask with our frontend and database under significant time pressure.

📚 What We Learned
  How to plan, design, and launch a full-stack project quickly.
  
  The importance of structuring a database for scalability and future features.
  
  Improved our technical skills across the entire tech stack.

🔮 What’s Next for ZenSpace
We see ZenSpace as more than just a spot-finder — it’s a community. Future features we want to add include:

  Gamification: Implementing a community rating and reward system.
  
  Interactive Maps: Showing top-rated spots near the user's location.
  
  Tutoring System: A feature to connect students seeking help with peers who can offer support.
