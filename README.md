ZenSpace

ZenSpace is a web app that helps students discover the best study and recreation spots around them, rated for productivity and well-being. Whether you need a quiet space with strong WiFi or a lively spot to recharge with friends, ZenSpace connects you to the right place.

Inspiration

As students, we often struggle to find the right place to study or relax. We’ve run into the same problem again and again: there’s no easy way to know about WiFi quality, noise levels, or availability of seats before arriving. ZenSpace was created to solve this frustration and make it easier to balance productivity and well-being.

What it does

ZenSpace allows students to:

Browse a list of study and recreation spots shared by peers.

View ratings for amenities like WiFi, seating, and noise level.

Find places that best match their needs, whether for focused studying or group projects.

How we built it

Frontend: ReactJS

Backend: Python with Flask (routes & API handling)

AI Integration: OpenAI API

Database: Custom setup with curated local spot data

Challenges we ran into

Combining study and recreation data in a way that felt intuitive.

Finding a reliable, low-cost (or free) database option.

Integrating the full stack (React + Flask + database) under hackathon time constraints.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Built a fully working MVP in 36 hours.

Designed a clean, user-friendly interface.

Successfully connected Flask, the frontend, and the database under time pressure.

What we learned

How to build and ship a full-stack project quickly.

The importance of planning and structuring the database for future growth.

Improved our technical skills across React, Flask, and API integration.

What's next for ZenSpace

We plan to expand ZenSpace with features like:

A community rating system to gamify engagement.

An interactive map with location-based search to find top-rated spots nearby.

A tutoring system to connect students beyond just study spots.
